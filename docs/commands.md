# Controls Setup

Our DC-3 has a lot of customized systems, and we **highly recommend** to create a unique controls profile.
We have implement some of the standard (default) commands, where it was possible, but also added custom commands, to allow proper controls of the aircraft.

The list below contains those commands that are essential. This document will be updated in the future, with any changes or additions.
