    !!! hint "INFO"
        The mixture control system, for the AUTO RICH and AUTO LEAN positions, achieves automatic control via a bellows system with trapped atmospheric pressure of 28 inHg. 
        As the altitude increases and the outside pressure drops, the bellows inflate, restricting gradually the fuel, thus leaning the mixture.
