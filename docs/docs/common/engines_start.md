# Engines Start Procedure

!!! note "NOTE"
    The procedure has slightly altered to be possible to execute with the most common hardware.
    We strongly suggest the use of the checklist supplied with the aircraft in the DC3 Settings window.


## Prerequisites 
1. Make sure that you have fuel in the tanks!
2. Check batteries' voltage. If your batteries are not fully charged you won't be able to start the engines.
To check batteries' voltage, open the Systems' window and check battery voltage. If the voltage is below ~20 volts,
or the external temperature is low, you should use the GPU to start the engines.

## First Steps
1. Select, for each engine side the tank that has more fuel.
2. Open the [Fire Extinguish Panel](../common/other.md#fire-extinguish-panel), and turn knob 3 to the first engine.
3. Turn on Master Magneto Switch.
4. Turn on Start Safety Switch.
5. Turn the engine's Generator on.
6. Make sure mixture control is at the CUT-OFF position.
7. Open the throttle a bit, about 1/10 of the full travel.
8. Propeller control full forward.
9. Carburetor heat control to cold.
10. Set Cowl Flaps to TRAIL or OPEN.

## Let's start the engine
We suggest to read once first the next steps before starting the execution, to have a better idea of the next steps, because you must perform them as fast as you can!

1. Set engine start switch to ON. You should be able to see the propeller rotating. Using the numer pad keys, 7 for the left and 9 for the right engine, to set the view outside looking the engine.
2. When the engine reach ~200 RPM, hold primer switch ON until RPMs go above 500.
3. As fast as you can, set the mixture control to **AUTO RICH**.
4. The engine should start, and the engine start switch will automatically flip to off position.

## After the engine started

1. With the engine around 600-800 RPM, check engine oil press rise.
2. Warm up the engine, until temperature and pressures withing "green area", at around 800-1000 RPM.
3. Use the build-in [checklist](../../gui.md#checklist) to preform the rest *after engine start* checks.
