# User Interface

The user interface is the means for the user to interact with various faces of the flight, and as well as set various options, aircraft loading, etc.

It is divided in 5 "tabs" or pages.

- **AIRFRAME:** Gives the user info about the aircraft, the available liveries, and Credits.

- **CHECKLIST:** A complete checklist, adapted for our aircraft. 

Click the small arrow on the left to open a checklist, and check the items. When a checklist is completed, the color of the specific checklist will turn from red to green, and the *completed* is added. This allows for a quick overview which checklist is complete and which not.
