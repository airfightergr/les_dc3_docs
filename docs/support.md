# Support

Before you request support, please read the current document. 

If you still have support questions, please do the below:

1. Visit [LES Support](https://forums.x-pilot.com/forums/forum/105-support/) forums.
2. Check the forums if the issue already exists, and may be already answered.
3. If not, start a new topic, and:
    - Describe in detail the issue you have, so we be able to reproduce.
    - If it is possible, attach and image or video indicating the issue. Forums have usually restricted space, you may upload to a service and post the link.
    - Always attach the **Log.txt** file, located in X-Plane's root folder, and the **DC3.log** file, located in **_Douglas DC-3 v2/resources/data/_** folder.

    
!!! note "NOTE"
    Make sure that you attach the Log.txt and DC3.log files, just after closing X-Plane. If you start X-Plane before doing so, the files will be overwritten, and the info we need will be lost!

Also, you can contact [X-Aviation Support](https://www.x-aviation.com/catalog/contact_us.php).

!!! note "NOTE"
    We will try to our best to solve you issue as soon as possible. In some cases, though, might take a few days, depending on the issue and our workload, to be able to respond. Please be patient!
