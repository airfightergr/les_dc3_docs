This version of the DC-3 is a complete rework of the previous version. Features List Fully redone 3D model, with PBR materials, and 4K textures. Compatible with experimental flight model. Fully developed custom systems. Some highlights: Electric system: Battery loses capacity when the aircraft is not flown. Generators' output is temperature dependent. Relays will not connect generators (even with switches on), if the output voltage is not above a certain voltage. Voltage output matches real aircraft's rpm-voltage relationship. Automatic Pilot: There are 2 options, a simplified version that uses X-Plane commands to simulate the Sperry A-3 Automatic pilot, and a custom one, simulates the A-3 operation. Navigation: Typical WWII era VOR and ADF radios. You can add a GPS unit (X-Plane's 430, RXP GNS 430, or RXP GTN 650), but they are not provide any guidance. Hydraulics: Extended simulation of the 2 hydraulic systems operation. Engines: Fully simulated mixture controls (auto-lean, auto-rich, emergency). Custom autofeather mechanism. Oil consumption depending on engines' health. Engines power output is depended to engines health. Fuel system: Fully simulated loading, controls, and indications. Modern UI (User Interface) with pages: Airframe: Overview of the available airframes, with information about the current airframe. Maintenance: Overview of aircraft\u2019s health situation, with controls to perform scheduled maintenance. Options: Select various items, like automatic pilot type, hardware controls, ground services, panel states, misc options. Loading: Controls to load the aircraft with passengers, cargo, and fuel. View CG on the CG chart. Checklist: Easy to use checklist to help you with your flight tasks. Particle system effects. Airframe system. Each livery is a unique different airframe, and changing liveries is like changing airframes! Options, maintenance logs, states, are following each one separately. Maintenance system. Every aircraft operation is tracked and logged. Aircraft's condition can be monitored through UI, and perform required maintenance tasks. Fully immersive fmod sounds. The aircraft is compatible with X-Plane 12 and will be supported through X-Plane 12 run. Things not in the v2.0.0 Systems not fully developed, but will be developed farther, throughout DC-3 v2 run: All aircraft Hydraulic system: All indication are correct, but until now X-Plane does not allow deep interaction with the system. Anti ice system: All systems are included, but not fully simulated, yet. Classic Sperry Autopilot: The basic operations is included, except the 'heading mode'. Modern Purchase You can purchase this aircraft at X-Aviation store .","title":"Welcome"},{"location":"#dc-3-operating-manual","text":"","title":"DC-3 Operating Manual"},{"location":"#introduction","text":"Welcome to Leading Edge Simulations Douglas DC-3, version 2.0.
