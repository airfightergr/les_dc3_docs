This version of the DC-3 is a complete rework of the previous version. Aircraft Types This DC-3 product package includes 2 different variations. The first, \"Classic\", is based on the early production DC-3 layouts, from late 1930's to mid 1940's era. The second, \"Modern\", is based on aircraft that have been retrofitted with more modern instruments and avionics. Features List Fully redone 3D model, with PBR materials, and 4K textures. Compatible with experimental flight model. Fully developed custom systems. Some highlights: Electric system: Battery loses capacity when the aircraft is not flown. Generators' output is temperature dependent. Relays will not connect generators (even with switches on), if the output voltage is not above a certain voltage. Voltage output matches real aircraft's rpm-voltage relationship. Automatic Pilot: There are 2 options, a simplified version that uses X-Plane commands to simulate the Sperry A-3 Automatic pilot, and a custom one, simulates the A-3 operation. Navigation: Typical WWII era VOR and ADF radios. You can add a GPS unit (X-Plane's 430, RXP GNS 430, or RXP GTN 650), but they are not provide any guidance. Hydraulics: Extended simulation of the 2 hydraulic systems' operation. Engines: Fully simulated mixture controls (auto-lean, auto-rich, emergency). Custom auto-feather mechanism. Oil consumption depending on engines' health. Engines power output is depended on engines' health. Fuel system: Fully simulated loading, controls, and indications. Modern UI (User Interface) with pages: Airframe: Overview of the available airframes, with information about the current airframe. Maintenance: Overview of aircraft\u2019s health situation, with controls to perform scheduled maintenance. Options: Select various items, like automatic pilot type, hardware controls, ground services, panel states, misc options. Loading: Controls to load the aircraft with passengers, cargo, and fuel. View CG on the CG chart. Checklist: Easy to use checklist to help you with your flight tasks. Particle system effects. Airframe system. Each livery is a unique different airframe, and changing liveries is like changing airframes! Options, maintenance logs, states, are following each one separately. Maintenance system. Every aircraft operation is tracked and logged. Aircraft's condition can be monitored through UI, and perform required maintenance tasks. Fully immersive fmod sounds. The aircraft is compatible with X-Plane 12 and will be supported through X-Plane 12 run. Things not in the v2.0.0 Systems not fully developed, but will be developed farther, throughout DC-3 v2 run: All aircraft Hydraulic system: All indication are correct, but until now X-Plane does not allow deep interaction with the system. Anti ice system: All systems are included, but not fully simulated, yet. Classic Sperry Autopilot: The basic operations is included, except the 'heading mode'. Modern Purchase You can purchase this aircraft at X-Aviation store .","title":"Welcome"},{"location":"#overview","text":"","title":"Overview"},{"location":"#introduction","text":"Welcome to Leading Edge Simulations Douglas DC-3, version 2.0.

VHF COMM 1 radio: Has 2 rotary knobs. The big controls the frequency MHz, and the small one the frequency KHz. The small flatheaded knob, is the volume control for the radio. VHF COMM 2 radio: Same as VHF COMM 1 radio. VHF NAV 1 radio: Controls NAV 1 (VOR 1). Same controls as the COMM radios. VHF NAV 2 radio: Same as VHF NAV 1 radio. ADF 1 radio: On the left is the MODE knob, with 3 positions: OFF - ADF - ANT. Turn the knob to ADF to have indications in the RMI. In the middle there are 3 frequency control knobs. The top controls 1s KHz, the middle 10s KHz, and the bottom 100s KHz. On the right side is the volume control. ADF 2 radio: Same as the ADF 1 radio. Transponder: Has 4 knobs, 2 left and 2 right, each one controls the respective transponder digit. Middle-bottom is the MODE knob, with 4 positions: OFF - SBY - ON - ALT. The ALT position is the same as ON, since this aircraft has not altitude reporting altimeter. On the left bottom side is the ID indicator (light). On the right bottom side is the IDENT button.","title":"Radios"},{"location":"docs/classic/radios/#radios","text":"The radio stack is located above pilots heads, on the cockpit ceiling.
